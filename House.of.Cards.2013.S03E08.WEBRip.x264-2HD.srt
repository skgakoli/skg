00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,909
When surface temperatures
in the Atlantic rise above 80 degrees,

3
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:50,912
conditions are ideal for a hurricane.

4
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,915
Westerly winds kick up condensation,

5
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:58,127
forming cumulonimbus clouds which begin
to revolve around a central axis.

6
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:01,715
On September seventh,
these exact conditions gave birth

7
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:04,050
to Hurricane Faith, currently barreling

8
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,512
toward the Eastern seaboard
of the United States.

9
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:10,557
On November 7th, 1984,

10
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,976
a different sort
of hurricane swirled into being.

11
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,688
A 25-year-old Harvard Law graduate

12
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:21,192
took South Carolina State
Senate District Fourteen by storm.

13
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:24,446
His name was Francis J. Underwood.

14
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:26,531
How strong will it be
when it hits?

15
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,492
Simulators say Cat Three,
possibly Cat Four.

16
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:31,912
Major devastation across a dozen states.

17
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:35,164
Yes, but some of these projections
have it turning back to sea.

18
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:38,084
That's highly unlikely, sir.

19
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,420
Sir, FEMA's mission
is to prepare for the worst.

20
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:43,965
First responders,
medical, mass evacuation.

21
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:47,009
I'm worried about the funding.

22
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,429
The Disaster Relief Fund
has been depleted by a third

23
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:52,265
- since you launched AmWorks.
- That still leaves two billion.

24
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:56,018
Well, for this storm,
we need four times that.

25
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:58,814
I'm about to meet with the leadership
to ask them to replenish the fund,

26
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,315
but I can't ask for that much.

27
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:04,486
We need eight billion minimum
for bare-bones preparation.

28
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,655
We shouldn't gamble
with something like this, sir.

29
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:09,407
Hundreds could die. Maybe thousands.

30
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,702
"The impossible made possible.

31
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:17,791
The thing no one else dares to do,
that everyone says can't be done.

32
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:22,671
Imagine a boy standing on the shores
of the Charleston Harbor.

33
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:28,134
Two miles away, a faint line
on the horizon, is Fort Sumter.

34
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:32,388
All the other boys say
it's impossible to swim there.

35
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,642
But this one boy thinks it can be done.

36
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:39,729
The others gasp as he kicks off
his shoes, plunges into the water.

37
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:42,858
They watch with shock
as he grows farther from the shore.

38
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:48,571
They whisper to each other solemnly,
'He'll drown. He'll never make it.'

39
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:51,157
'No, he'll turn around
when it gets too hard.'"

40
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,701
Mr. President.

41
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:55,704
Have a seat. I'll have Jessica
bring in some refreshments.

42
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,331
Henry Mitchell,
the new Senate Majority Leader.

43
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,916
What happened to Hector Mendoza?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,211
Well, you don't declare a couple
of paid speeches as income and boom,

45
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:06,047
you're no longer in Congress,
and certainly not running for president.

46
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,509
You got rid of Ronnie.
Hector loved that painting.

47
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,594
He's not gone, just in storage.

48
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:12,971
Just like Hector.

49
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:16,391
My father served under Eisenhower.
Drove his jeep in Normandy.

50
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:18,727
Your father was at D-Day?

51
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,563
Utah Beach. At Bastogne too.

52
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:24,315
Isn't this just a little love fest.

53
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,069
Gentlemen, the hurricane.
I need the DRF replenished.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,740
The Speaker's calling
for an emergency session tonight.

55
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:33,950
We're prepared to allocate ten billion.

56
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,869
I was only gonna ask for eight.

57
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:38,872
You sign the bill,
you'll get the ten billion.

58
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:42,834
But no FEMA money
or any other agency funds can be used

59
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,587
for your jobs program again,
under any circumstances.

60
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,296
Don't politicize this.

61
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,050
America Works and the hurricane
are two separate issues.

62
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,635
Excuse me, Mr. President,

63
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,764
but you're the one that raided
the DRF for political purposes.

64
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,223
We're correcting a wrong.

65
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:59,768
And jeopardizing
the entire Eastern Seaboard.

66
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,020
That's on the White House,
not on us.

67
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:04,981
We're supplying the funds,
the money you took illegally.

68
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:08,192
If you choose not to sign the bill,
we can't be blamed.

69
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,318
We stepped up.

70
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:16,785
I thought you might try
to make this about America Works.

71
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:19,245
And look, I admit, I may have overstepped.

72
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,956
But let me show you something.

73
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,542
Every day, I ask the Comms office
to give me profiles

74
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:28,630
of ten AmWorks beneficiaries.
These are success stories.

75
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:33,051
This is just a fraction of the 40,000
people that we put back to work.

76
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:36,136
With money that wasn't appropriated
for that purpose.

77
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,640
You don't get
to break the piggy bank

78
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:41,559
then ask us to glue it together
and put in more pennies.

79
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:44,938
I've got over 50 Democrats
and Republicans in both houses

80
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:48,650
that have publicly supported
America Works since its introduction.

81
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:49,901
The tide is turning.

82
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:52,152
Your own people
are getting behind the program.

83
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:55,573
Then where are they now?
Why aren't we getting calls?

84
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:58,868
Why do they all support
this emergency bill?

85
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:01,329
If you pass it, I'll veto it,
but there's no reason

86
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,414
we have to turn this
into a pissing match.

87
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:05,959
You know that we have the votes
to override your veto.

88
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,045
It passes in ten days
without a signature, regardless.

89
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:14,009
The only question is whether you're
gonna sign it before that hurricane hits,

90
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:17,428
or watch it become law
after thousands have died.

91
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,348
Henry...

92
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:25,353
I sat with Hector dozens of times
at this very table

93
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:29,983
and we were always able to work out
our differences, to negotiate.

94
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,568
This isn't Hector's office anymore.

95
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:34,236
Or his table.

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,740
Gentlemen, is there no room
for a compromise?

97
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:39,742
- No.
- Bob?

98
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,285
No, Mr. President.

99
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:45,247
It's going wide in an hour.

100
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,291
Seven governors,
all up and down the East Coast.

101
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,251
They're demanding
that you sign the bill.

102
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,379
- Who tipped you off?
- Jim Matthews' flack.

103
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:53,589
Matthews is turning on us? What's it say?

104
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:56,926
"President Underwood has undermined
the separation of powers

105
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,429
and put the fate of the entire
East Coast in Hurricane Faith's hands.

106
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:03,725
I am joining with the Governors
of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland--"

107
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,601
That's enough.
I don't need to hear any more.

108
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,563
See how many governors you can get
on the phone in 30 minutes.

109
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:10,773
- Yes, sir.
- I've got something else for you, sir.

110
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:13,109
The AmWorks case studies.
These are your ten for the day.

111
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:16,029
- I don't have time for that now.
- You should see this top file.

112
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,833
Freddy's working as a dishwasher.

113
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,419
He was one of the first people to sign up.

114
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,720
Should I prepare a statement
in response to the governors?

115
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,724
Sir?

116
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,893
No statement. No. Not yet.

117
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:48,310
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,776
- Yes, sir?
- Send a message to the entire cabinet.

119
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,028
I want a meeting tomorrow morning,
first thing.

120
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,448
"During his tenure as whip,

121
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:05,203
Underwood was known for employing
intimidation, bravado and fear.

122
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:09,832
His recent stance against Russia is
a continuation of strong-arm diplomacy,

123
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,502
carried out by his wife,
whom he appointed UN ambassador

124
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:16,338
despite the Senate voting her down.

125
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:20,051
The use of FEMA funds
for America Works shocked many,

126
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:24,597
but it's simply the most recent
in a career's worth of unilateral moves.

127
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,769
Minority Leader Bob Birch said,
'The President consistently demonstrates

128
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:34,023
an utter lack of partnership
coupled with reckless abandon.'"

129
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:38,027
Sir, have you given any thought
to simply signing the bill

130
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:40,155
that Congress passed last night?

131
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,748
How many of you think
I should sign the bill?

132
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:53,334
Well, surely, some of you think I should.

133
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:59,757
You know, I think too often, the people
in this room are afraid of upsetting me.

134
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,092
And that's my fault.

135
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:05,180
I discourage dissent when it doesn't go
with the things that I want.

136
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:09,892
So, I want you to be honest with me.
I won't hold it against you.

137
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:12,520
How many of you think
I should sign the bill?

138
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:42,967
Thank you.

139
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:46,512
You have all worked very hard
to get AmWorks up and running.

140
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,472
I don't want to sign its death warrant

141
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:52,352
until we have exhausted
every resource available to us first.

142
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,937
So I need every department
to draft a proposal

143
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,191
of what they could do
in response to the hurricane.

144
00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:02,362
And if we still fall short,
I'll sign the bill.

145
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:03,863
Is that okay with everyone?

146
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,408
Let's aim for the day after tomorrow.
Thank you all very much.

147
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,914
The starting salary for an employee
at Walmart is below the poverty line.

148
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,626
Now, the American government
subsidizes Walmart

149
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,589
to the tune of 7.8 billion dollars a year,

150
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:26,719
by issuing food stamps
to over one in ten of its workers.

151
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:28,596
But here's the scary part.

152
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,892
Fifteen percent of all food stamps
are actually used at Walmart.

153
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:38,439
Meaning Walmart gets to double dip
into the federal government's coffers.

154
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:41,525
I'm as angry about it as you are.

155
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:46,697
Because Walmart's top executives
have reaped almost 300 million

156
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:51,286
in tax-deductible performance pay
over the last six years.

157
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:53,788
That needs to stop!

158
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,210
We need to raise the minimum wage!

159
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:08,010
Cut down on corporate greed
by regulating bonuses.

160
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,642
It's time to balance the scales.

161
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:24,526
- Can we go through your call sheet?
- Just give me a second to decompress.

162
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,904
We've only got a half hour
until the next event.

163
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,532
- Doug called?
- While you were giving your speech.

164
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,785
- What about?
- He wouldn't say.

165
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:02,606
How'd it go in Cedar Rapids?

166
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,651
Well. We got AFSCME on board.
Good turnout. What's up?

167
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,154
Sharp has an event in Dubuque tomorrow.

168
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:10,281
You're scheduled to be there too.

169
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:12,283
- And?
- Meet with her.

170
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,327
- Somewhere discreet.
- Why?

171
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,912
If we assume that Underwood is running,
and we do,

172
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:19,790
we should also assume
that Sharp is on his team.

173
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,876
That doesn't answer the question.

174
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,296
I'm sure that Cynthia will object.
Hello, Cynthia.

175
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,923
- Hello, Doug.
- Object to what?

176
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,138
You're going to talk to Sharp
about the hurricane.

177
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:37,350
...that are perceived
as helping average citizens

178
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,767
feel more empowered.

179
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:41,521
Who are some
of the bill's key opponents

180
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:44,065
and what are hearing
in their on floor messaging?

181
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:47,276
Well, the White House
would be the most prominent opponent

182
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,862
if they slap the veto threat
on this, saying it's--

183
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:53,032
- Oh. Thank you, Cynthia.
- You usually work out at midnight?

184
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:57,203
My workout is the only time of day
the press corps gives me some privacy.

185
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:01,623
- How did your event go tonight?
- Fine.

186
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,753
I called bingo for half an hour
at an old folks' home.

187
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:08,797
Well, that's pretty good.
Something a little different.

188
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:12,592
You gonna steal it the way you stole
my talking points on the FEMA bill?

189
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,303
You made good points.

190
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:17,390
I'm not above agreeing with the opposition
when they're right.

191
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,100
Mm...

192
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:23,521
But I'm surprised you've been so critical.
I thought you and Underwood were close.

193
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,732
I'm not above disagreeing with an ally
when they're wrong.

194
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:32,321
In the spirit of what's right, I want you
to know I'm suspending my campaign.

195
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,365
When the storm makes landfall,

196
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:37,910
I'm going to ask people
to donate to the Red Cross instead.

197
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:40,704
And I'll be heading out east to volunteer.

198
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:43,916
That doesn't sound like a suspension.
That sounds like opportunism.

199
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,877
No. I'll ask the press to leave me be.

200
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:50,714
I can't force them to,
but we won't offer any logistical support.

201
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:53,801
You want me to suspend as well?

202
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,844
We can announce together.

203
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:57,888
That takes the politics out of this.

204
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,768
The cynical side of me
thinks that it benefits you

205
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,645
if I stop my fundraising
right when I'm hitting my stride.

206
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:08,483
Well, I'm not appealing
to the cynical side.

207
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:13,404
I'll leave you to your workout.

208
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,698
You have kids now.

209
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,120
- I have a husband. He has kids.
- You don't consider them your own?

210
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:22,788
It's late, Heather.

211
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,707
I bring it up because they ground me.

212
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:31,922
I don't know if you've felt this way
since you got married, but...

213
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:36,260
when I think about my kids
and this hurricane...

214
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:39,597
What if we didn't have the money
and advantages we do?

215
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,349
What if they were in harm's way?

216
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:44,435
What if they needed help
and didn't have it?

217
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,105
Puts everything into perspective for me.

218
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:50,774
This... campaign seems meaningless.

219
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:54,862
It pales in comparison
to their well-being.

220
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,534
Have you felt that at all?

221
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,494
Since you became a mother?

222
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,626
"Consulting with state governments"
is way too dry.

223
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,336
Put in "working closely."

224
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,713
- Don't you think that's disingenuous?
- Why?

225
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,257
These seven governors just
publicly condemned the president.

226
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:16,425
"Working closely"?

227
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:19,845
Well, I condemn you every day
but I still work closely with you.

228
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,349
So, I need to take this phone call.

229
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:26,310
Uh... punch it up, bring it back to me.

230
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:30,064
- Doug?
- I have a message for the president.

231
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,273
What is it?

232
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:34,235
Tell him Jackie and Dunbar
met in Dubuque tonight.

233
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:36,362
And tell him I'm the one who told you.

234
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,113
What did they meet about?

235
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:41,492
Suspending their campaigns
after the hurricane hits.

236
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:44,286
- How do you know this?
- Just tell him.

237
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,830
Are you working for Jackie,
under the radar?

238
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,874
- No.
- Dunbar?

239
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,460
I'm just looking out for the president.

240
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:54,630
Give him the information
and tell him who it came from.

241
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,340
I'll let you know if I learn more.

242
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:07,268
"The water was cold
and the current was strong.

243
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:10,145
With every stroke,
the boy had to fight off chills

244
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:13,148
and battle the tide rushing in
from the sea.

245
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:16,485
Anyone watching him,
as his schoolmates did from the shore,

246
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:20,239
barely making out a tiny speck
moving slowly across the water,

247
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:22,700
would've thought he stood no chance.

248
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,078
But that thought never
entered the boy's mind.

249
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:29,624
His muscles ached, his heart pounded,

250
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:32,627
but the water would not defeat him."

251
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:37,506
I want rec centers and town halls,
but the most important thing is schools.

252
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,133
They're the key.

253
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:42,428
Well, every school east of Ohio.

254
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,474
You tell the governors that push back,
tell them we'll pay for the shutdown days

255
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,601
and overtime with what's left in the DRF.

256
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:52,313
No, we'll figure out how to get people
there through some other department.

257
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:54,273
Just get me the schools!

258
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:57,610
I keep telling them
to stop bringing those.

259
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:58,986
I know. I got these myself.

260
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,697
Oh, thank you. That's sweet.

261
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,283
- Any progress?
- Some, but not enough.

262
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,789
Did you mean it today,
when you raised your hand?

263
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:10,956
No.

264
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,418
But I knew if I did, the others
who wanted to would be less afraid.

265
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:17,588
Is that it? The bill?

266
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:21,342
Yes. They delivered it
just after the cabinet meeting.

267
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,053
Maybe I should just sign the damn thing.

268
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:28,474
The longer I wait,
the bigger target I become.

269
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,351
Well, the cabinet's working hard.

270
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,936
Stick to your guns
and give them some time.

271
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,857
Well, it could turn. Or dissipate.

272
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,110
Hurricane Humberto was
on the same trajectory as Faith.

273
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,988
Everyone thought that was gonna
wipe out seven states,

274
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:47,284
but in the end, it turned south
and never became more than a Cat One.

275
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:52,373
- How good are the chances?
- Extremely poor.

276
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:56,627
But... there's still some hope.

277
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,754
Relax for a minute, Francis.

278
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,803
We should cancel the UN ceremony tomorrow.

279
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,055
- What?
- Maybe it sends the wrong message.

280
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:11,433
No, it's a great victory for you. For us.

281
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:13,977
But celebrating in the middle
of a crisis, I don't--

282
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,605
Well, that's exactly
what we should be doing.

283
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,649
You made this resolution happen.

284
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:22,820
It's the one good notch we have on our
belt since we moved into the White House.

285
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:26,948
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let this hurricane rob us of that.

286
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,621
"When Congress refused to support
a peacekeeping mission

287
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:36,291
in the Jordan Valley, the president
deployed troops anyway,

288
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,003
stating his authority
as Commander in Chief."

289
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,882
"The ramparts of the fort
were still a mile away.

290
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:45,342
But he had reached
the point of no return.

291
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:49,304
Turning back was no longer an option."

292
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:53,434
"With the world's eyes upon him,
he continues to ignore precedent,

293
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:56,771
convention, and some would say the law."

294
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,940
"Why did he
cross that invisible line?

295
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:03,444
Why risk his life despite
the great odds stacked against him?"

296
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:08,741
"Critics have been harsh.
And yet most have stopped short

297
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:12,160
of naming Underwood what he truly is:
a tyrant."

298
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,749
"What drove Napoleon
to keep marching toward Moscow?

299
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:19,501
Or Hannibal to cross the Alps?"

300
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:23,338
"The warning signs are there.
It's our responsibility to heed them."

301
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:26,842
"What kept a young Frank Underwood
swimming onward?

302
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,136
And what kept him from drowning?"

303
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,681
How did Seth learn this?

304
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,476
- Jackie's comms director.
- And this happened last night?

305
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,895
- From what I can gather.
- So why am I just hearing about it now?

306
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,648
- I didn't hear about it before.
- She was trying to keep it a secret.

307
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,483
But you're supposed to be
keeping tabs on her.

308
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:45,026
The fact that you didn't know,
and only found out from Seth--

309
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,195
I'm not in Iowa, sir.
I'm here running your staff.

310
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,155
Excuse me?

311
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:50,240
Just because Jackie and I
have a personal history

312
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,033
doesn't mean I know her every movement.

313
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:54,244
We are not talking about
your ex-girlfriend.

314
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,330
We're talking about my running mate.

315
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,792
And if she can't be trusted, I can't force
her to reveal things she doesn't want to.

316
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,377
You convinced me to make the deal with her
in the first place.

317
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,421
We needed information. She had access.

318
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,923
And now she's lying to us.

319
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,592
Maybe you should speak with her
before we consider this a crisis.

320
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,010
I don't like your tone, Remy.

321
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,596
- You're blowing this out of proportion.
- Watch yourself.

322
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,808
When I worked for you in Congress, you
always told me to be straight up with you.

323
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:17,810
I wasn't the president then.

324
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:20,479
So you just want me to apologize
and be a yes-man?

325
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:23,524
I want you to treat this office
with respect.

326
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:25,192
You owe your staff that same respect.

327
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,778
I gave you a position in the White House
when no one would touch you.

328
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,738
I don't owe you a damn thing.

329
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,532
How long you gonna hang that over my head?

330
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,243
- Oh, it's like you want me to fire you.
- You couldn't, and you know it.

331
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,413
Not right now.

332
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,582
Seth and I are the only
two soldiers you have.

333
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,588
- Get Jackie on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:14,533
Sir, Congresswoman Sharp calling for you.

335
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:15,993
I'll take it in here.

336
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:24,668
Sir, we'll gladly polish those for you.

337
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,254
I'm happy to do it myself. Thank you.

338
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:28,756
Yes, sir.

339
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:37,180
- Congresswoman.
- I apologize if you hear chewing.

340
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:40,141
This is the first chance I've gotten
to eat all day. Non-stop events.

341
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:43,311
I'm surprised you have an appetite
after meeting with Dunbar.

342
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,484
Her people asked. I said yes.

343
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:52,320
I thought I'd see what she wanted
before bothering you with it.

344
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:55,824
Suspending your campaigns?
I'm assuming that you told her no.

345
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,870
I told her yes.

346
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:05,125
You realize she's just preying upon
your good nature to stop your fundraising.

347
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,211
Even if that were the case,
the politics work in my favor too.

348
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:11,172
It's insensitive to campaign
during a catastrophe this big.

349
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,424
It could backfire on me.

350
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,927
We don't know that it's
going to be a catastrophe.

351
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,222
Weathermen can be wrong, Mr. President,
but not every weatherman in the country.

352
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,933
All right, even if that's true,

353
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:24,561
you should attack her for using
the hurricane to score sympathy points.

354
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:27,898
I've discussed it with my staff.

355
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:32,235
This isn't just your campaign, Jackie,
this is our campaign.

356
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:38,325
May I offer you some advice, sir?
Sign the bill.

357
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:43,330
If you don't, and the storm hits,
you and I won't have a campaign.

358
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:45,624
You should get back to your dinner.

359
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:24,913
Hey, everyone. Let's put down the dishes
for a second. I need to talk to you.

360
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:28,542
Here's the deal.
I hired you three under America Works.

361
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,961
And as much as we can use the manpower,

362
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:34,089
I can't afford it
if the program gets ended.

363
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:37,968
I might be able to afford to keep
two of you if you split shifts,

364
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:39,720
but I can't keep all three.

365
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:46,434
"A storm has been forming
not for weeks, but for decades.

366
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:49,021
Its name is not Faith, it's Francis.

367
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:53,316
The entire nation is in his path,
and if we ignore the warning signs,

368
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,737
- we have no one but ourselves to blame.
- "...no one but ourselves to blame."

369
00:23:57,863 --> 00:24:00,032
It's not an article.
It's an opinion piece.

370
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,700
I know.

371
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:03,994
The paper can't take
this editorial stance.

372
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,621
- It's too speculative.
- I'm aware. Print it as a column.

373
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:09,248
The moment I do that,
you cross over to the other side.

374
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:10,709
We can't keep you on your beat.

375
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,878
So replace me.

376
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,796
I want a column. It's time.

377
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,757
Kate, you're on track
to be managing editor.

378
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,843
You toss that out the window the moment
you switch over to being a columnist.

379
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:23,931
I don't want to be editing other people's
words. I want to be writing my own.

380
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:26,474
And not just the news,
I want my ideas out there.

381
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,977
You know the Telegraph
will let you do anything you want.

382
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,979
But we need you reporting
on the president.

383
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:33,565
- Nobody does it better.
- My bias is clear.

384
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:36,443
You shouldn't keep me on
as a reporter anyway.

385
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:40,030
I'll tell you what. We can make
this work as an analysis piece.

386
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:43,366
You tone down the speculation,
stick to the facts and quotes--

387
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,493
- Speculation is the entire point.
- Fine.

388
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:49,206
Just... give me a little something
from the other side, to balance it out.

389
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,958
You know they're not gonna
give me a quote.

390
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:54,669
Even if it's a source just tangentially
associated with the administration.

391
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:57,965
You do that, we can print this
and keep you as a reporter.

392
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,761
I got an idea who I can talk to.

393
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:09,768
"On another day, with warmer water,
with the current carrying him,

394
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:11,186
he might have made it.

395
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,773
But on this day, he would only make it
halfway before his arms gave out

396
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:17,276
and the numbness overtook him,
before the coast guard

397
00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:20,237
pulled him out of the water
despite his protests.

398
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,116
Was he reckless? Was he foolish?

399
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,284
Possibly.

400
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:28,203
One thing can't be denied, however.

401
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:32,666
What others saw as impossible,
he refused to believe as such.

402
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:36,503
The water proved him wrong.
He fell far short of the other shore.

403
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:38,546
And yet he made the attempt.

404
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,675
And that... is everything."

405
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,432
That's just the prologue.

406
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:56,148
You don't mention America Works once.

407
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,192
On purpose.

408
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:02,361
That is what the book
is supposed to be about, isn't it?

409
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,239
You don't like it?

410
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:08,660
I do like it.
I just wonder if I...

411
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:14,373
Well, maybe I don't...
understand what you're trying to do.

412
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:19,378
Nobody cares about an idea.

413
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:22,674
They might care
about a man with an idea.

414
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,635
I only care about the man.

415
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,473
The whole book will be like this...
these vignettes.

416
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:33,852
Like a collection of short stories.

417
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:37,272
Do you mention AmWorks anywhere?

418
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:38,690
Nope.

419
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:41,235
Not once.

420
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,698
Well...

421
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:52,620
I did want the book to be different,
but I... It just seems that that might--

422
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:56,375
I think it might be the best thing
I've written in years.

423
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:59,418
It could also be utter and complete shit.

424
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:02,881
But when I can't tell the difference,
it's usually a good sign.

425
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:08,427
I just don't want to lose sight
of the bigger goal.

426
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,597
I don't know any other way to write it.

427
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:16,186
If you want something different,
now's the time to find somebody else.

428
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,272
No, I want you to finish it.

429
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:21,691
Even though I have...

430
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,029
no idea if it will end up
being relevant if I end up...

431
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,283
signing this bill.

432
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:30,742
Are you going to?

433
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:34,413
I don't know yet.

434
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:39,960
If I do, of course, I'll pay you in full
if the book becomes unnecessary.

435
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,380
I'm not doing this for the paycheck.

436
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:48,302
What do you think?

437
00:27:49,594 --> 00:27:50,804
Should I sign it?

438
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,931
Well, I have skin in the game.

439
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:55,225
So the selfish part of me says no.

440
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:59,229
But...

441
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:01,940
honestly?

442
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,818
No book is worth people
losing their lives.

443
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,195
Yes, but it's not just about the book.

444
00:28:08,196 --> 00:28:10,073
It's about putting people back to work.

445
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:12,326
People can't work if they're dead.

446
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:19,458
Well, I'm gonna obviously
be very occupied

447
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,294
by this hurricane
for the foreseeable future.

448
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:23,795
Let me think on this for...

449
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,344
You'd better not fuck him over.

450
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:33,180
- Excuse me?
- With what you're writing.

451
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:34,889
I don't intend to.

452
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:37,225
- The part about being foolish?
- You eavesdropping?

453
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:39,686
- He's not foolish.
- That wasn't my point.

454
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:41,855
I wouldn't take a bullet
for a man who was.

455
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:46,318
Let's go, your car's waiting.

456
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:53,241
As of tomorrow, Congresswoman Sharp
and I are suspending our campaigns.

457
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:56,536
We will be traveling to areas
affected by Hurricane Faith,

458
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:59,789
along with our campaign staff,
in order to volunteer

459
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:02,709
in whatever capacity is most helpful.

460
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,086
We're also suspending any donations,

461
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,839
and urge our supporters
to donate to the Red Cross

462
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:10,300
and other hurricane relief agencies.

463
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:14,637
In times of suffering,
it's important to suspend politics

464
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,265
and do what's best for the country.

465
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:19,476
We look forward to resuming our campaigns

466
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,979
when the storm has cleared
and the people of the east coast are safe.

467
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:28,026
Freddy?

468
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:34,115
The President would
like to see you, Mr. Hayes.

469
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,576
I still got two hours left on my shift.

470
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,953
It's fine, Freddy. You can go.

471
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,665
Do you mind if I bring my grandson?

472
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:45,752
Daycare got shut down 'cause of the storm.

473
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,837
Of course. We got a car waiting.

474
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,007
Come on, DeShawn.

475
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:55,845
We going to see the president.

476
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,518
Freddy.

477
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,524
- It's good to see you, Frank.
- Thank you for coming.

478
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:11,403
And this must be DeShawn.
How are you, sir?

479
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:14,864
Oh. That is a firm handshake you have.

480
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:17,409
Well, you want to go over
and sit at the desk?

481
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,411
Go ahead.

482
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:31,089
Yeah, I do that too, sometimes.

483
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,052
That desk might be yours one day.

484
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,179
Would you like to be the president?

485
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:40,223
Yeah.

486
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:43,602
Well, to be president,
you have to get good grades in school.

487
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:46,313
Now, I see you brought
some of your schoolwork with you.

488
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:48,607
I have an office
just around the corner in here,

489
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,775
maybe you'd like
to go do your work in there.

490
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:55,113
Or we also have a PlayStation
if you'd rather play that.

491
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:57,240
- What games you got?
- Oh, we have plenty of games.

492
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:58,908
Meechum will show you.

493
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:11,004
What can I get for you?
Coffee, a soda, a beer?

494
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:13,340
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Please sit down.

495
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:21,055
- You signed up for America Works.
- I did.

496
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:24,976
I've got 40,000 case studies
just like yours.

497
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:29,564
And I also have a bill on my desk that's
gonna cut the funding for all 40,000.

498
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,483
Yeah, I been following on the news.

499
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,109
I'm gonna sign it.

500
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,820
There's too many lives at stake
with this storm.

501
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,614
Sounds like the right thing to do.

502
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:42,076
Freddy, you deserve a job, and Congress
is forcing me to take it away.

503
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,120
I've spoken to our head of operations,

504
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,623
and if you want it,
there's a job for you here.

505
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:49,543
- Now, it's not charity, but--
- What's the pay?

506
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:51,419
Well, I don't know the exact figures,

507
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:54,005
but I figure somewhere around
three grand a month.

508
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,550
- I know that's not great, but I--
- Healthcare?

509
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,593
Well, yes, of course. That's included.

510
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:01,888
- For DeShawn, too?
- That's right. All dependents.

511
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:04,474
- What's the job?
- The kitchen.

512
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,476
Helping prep food for the chefs.

513
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,937
Well, as long as it's, you know,
above 2,800 a month.

514
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:13,441
That's what I need to make my rent and
make sure DeShawn has everything he needs.

515
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:16,277
I'll put you in touch
with the head chef right away.

516
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:19,698
I was wondering...
if you had anything else?

517
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,783
- Besides the kitchen.
- Well, I just assumed that--

518
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:25,161
I've been working in kitchens
my whole life.

519
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:28,456
Just 'cause I owned a rib joint
don't mean I like working in 'em.

520
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,251
Well, what would you rather do?

521
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:33,211
You got groundskeepers out there.

522
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:37,757
I noticed 'em choppin' branches when
we were driving in, for the hurricane.

523
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:40,093
You'd prefer that?

524
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:42,512
Always wanted to work outside.

525
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:45,348
Well, I'm sure that something
can be arranged.

526
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:49,977
I want to be president one day.

527
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,231
- Well, that's never gonna happen.
- But he said I could be.

528
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:56,067
Listen up, boy. He lied to you.

529
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,986
The truth is,
you ain't never gonna be president.

530
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,865
It's just like them basketball players
you got posters of.

531
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:05,868
They say you can do anything,
be a superstar, too.

532
00:33:05,952 --> 00:33:09,289
But they were born to be seven feet tall
and if they wasn't,

533
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:11,040
tell me what would they have?

534
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,292
Nothing.

535
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:15,420
Half of them can't even read a damn book.

536
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,964
No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.

537
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:22,552
It's good to have dreams,
just so long as they're not fantasies.

538
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:25,430
You let anybody sell you that shit,
it's your own damn fault.

539
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:27,724
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you, Pop.

540
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,577
I'll get it to the House right away.

541
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,996
- Green light on the release?
- Yes.

542
00:33:57,878 --> 00:34:00,047
I don't remember giving you
my phone number.

543
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:04,218
You didn't. Your publisher did.
He wants me to write a book.

544
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:06,721
I'm surprised you never have.

545
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:10,475
I'm sure any book you wrote
would do ten times what mine do.

546
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:12,935
Not as much as Scorpio.

547
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:16,564
As any I've written since.

548
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,566
I read it in college.

549
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,068
Did it change your life?

550
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:22,903
That's what you hear
all day long, isn't it?

551
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:26,073
If I still got recognized on the street,
which I don't.

552
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:29,828
Mostly at book signings, which I don't
recommend if you write your book.

553
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,830
I didn't ask you here
to discuss my book.

554
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:33,956
- No?
- I want to discuss yours.

555
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,124
Oh...

556
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,545
I'm working on a piece,
and it won't go to print

557
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:41,047
unless I get a comment
from the White House.

558
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,590
I'm not a part of the White House.

559
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:47,053
Doesn't even have to be a quote, just
something... that I can paraphrase, like,

560
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:50,056
"According to someone
close to the administration..."

561
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,726
- Doesn't have to be on the record.
- I'm not commenting on the book.

562
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:55,144
Tom, you got access no one else has.

563
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:59,106
For a reason. 'Cause he knows
I won't talk. Especially to you.

564
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:03,862
Well, can I buy you a drink?

565
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:05,446
Getting me drunk won't work.

566
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,449
You came out to meet me here.
I owe you one.

567
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,285
Why don't I buy you a drink?

568
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,248
How about we have a few?

569
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:18,251
A few.

570
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,960
I can live with that.

571
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,220
I'm so sorry, Francis.
I know how hard this is.

572
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:32,223
It was out of my hands.
I can't control the weather.

573
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:34,434
Still.

574
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:39,606
What frustrates me more than anything
is we were starting to turn the ship.

575
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:42,483
I was getting support in Congress.
A few more months...

576
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:46,279
and the leadership would've had no choice
but to support America Works.

577
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,618
Well, if it's any solace,
Cathy just called.

578
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:54,495
The Russians are willing
to contribute troops.

579
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:56,122
To the peacekeeping force?

580
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:58,374
They don't want to be left out.

581
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,126
No catch, no conditions?

582
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:03,087
None. There's too much pressure
on them in the UN.

583
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,131
So the isolation worked.

584
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:07,675
They're sending 300 troops.

585
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:09,636
That's incredible.

586
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,807
- We did it.
- Oh, no, not we. It was all you.

587
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,183
- Join me for dinner?
- I'm gonna turn in.

588
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,268
This early, huh?

589
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:20,062
I'm gonna be up three straight days
once this hurricane hits.

590
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,981
I need to get all the sleep I can.

591
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:25,151
That's a good idea.
I'll leave you be.

592
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,826
Have one of the stewards wake me
when it hits the coast.

593
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,221
Francis.

594
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:57,350
Francis?

595
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:03,606
Where did it make landfall?

596
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,108
- It didn't.
- What?

597
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:07,694
The hurricane turned.

598
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:14,659
It's due east now.
It might hit Bermuda.

599
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:18,621
But it'll, uh, dissipate quickly
now that it's reaching colder water.

600
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:21,123
It looks like we dodged a bullet,
Mr. President.

601
00:37:21,207 --> 00:37:24,418
I barely got the money in time
for a halfway decent response.

602
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,179
How do we pull back on the bill?

603
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:37,264
Already delivered to Congress,
we put out a release.

604
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:40,351
There must be some parliamentary procedure
that will nullify my signature.

605
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:41,978
I checked with the White House counsel.

606
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:45,231
The bill is officially law
and the money's already been appropriated.

607
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:54,991
FEMA is assisting thousands
of evacuees returning to their homes.

608
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:58,745
With the exception of moderate flooding in
Georgia due to rain from the outer bands,

609
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:02,623
the rest of the Eastern Seaboard
was left virtually untouched

610
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:06,126
by the hurricane everyone expected
to be the storm of the century.

611
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,547
The biggest casualty to Faith
was not life or property, however,

612
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,551
but rather President Underwood's
controversial America Works plan,

613
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:16,345
which Congress defunded
in order to free up resources

614
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,389
for storm-related disaster relief.

615
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:21,976
The president himself signed
the emergency appropriation into law

616
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,064
after facing immense pressure
from both parties and the media.

617
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:30,359
So you're out of a job, I guess.

618
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:35,239
Probably. Wouldn't be the first time.

619
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:40,703
If it makes you feel any better, there's
no way my story'll get printed now.

620
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:43,205
Why? Because I wouldn't give you a quote?

621
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:47,001
- No, it was a whole hurricane metaphor.
- Hm...

622
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:50,046
Kind of takes the wind out of the sails
if there's no hurricane.

623
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:52,423
Well...

624
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,427
at least you got laid.

625
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,098
Yep. That... that's poetic.

626
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,559
Yeah. I'm a writer.

627
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,144
Yeah.

628
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:17,698
- What is it?
- I gotta go.

629
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:19,867
Is that your way of getting rid of me?

630
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:22,369
No. It's the president.

631
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:31,629
I'm gonna need the shirt back.

632
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:44,642
If you asked me over to let me go,
it wasn't necessary.

633
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:47,436
- But I appreciate the thoughtfulness.
- I'm not letting you go.

634
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,271
This book is more important now than ever.

635
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,691
But... America Works is done.

636
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:54,527
Well, there's only one way
to get it back on track.

637
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,030
I'm announcing my candidacy for 2016.

638
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:58,865
- Wow.
- I couldn't run before.

639
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:01,534
I didn't have the money and I didn't
have the leadership's backing.

640
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:03,911
But now that I've proven
what AmWorks can do,

641
00:40:03,995 --> 00:40:06,413
the money and the support will be there.

642
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:09,876
A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works.

643
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,419
- You were right.
- How was I right?

644
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:15,798
Come over here,
take a look out the window.

645
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:23,181
- You see that man working over there?
- Mm-hm.

646
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:25,641
- That's Freddy Hayes.
- The ribs guy?

647
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:29,645
- He's a groundskeeper now.
- That's generous of you.

648
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:32,065
No, it wasn't. It's my job.

649
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:35,735
You wrote that I refuse to see
the impossible as impossible.

650
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:37,611
Freddy is one job.

651
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:39,947
I have ten million more to go.

652
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,076
That's my story
and that's why you were right.

653
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,536
So you wanna get back to work?

654
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,121
I'm in.

655
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,917
Now? I don't have my notebook.

656
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:53,836
Oh, um...

657
00:40:57,631 --> 00:41:00,509
The pen I signed the bill with.

658
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:05,139
All right. Let's do it.

659
00:41:05,223 --> 00:41:07,516
I never tried to swim to Fort Sumter.

660
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,895
Thomas probably knows I made it up,
but he wrote about it anyway

661
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:13,231
because he understands the greater truth:

662
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:16,692
imagination is its own form of courage.

663
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,279
Let's talk more about that swim.

664
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:23,157
I really did come
this close to drowning.

665
