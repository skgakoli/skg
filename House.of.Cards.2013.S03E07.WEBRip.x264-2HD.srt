00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:51,863
Do you renew your commitment to this
woman as your lawful wedded wife,

4
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:55,742
to love her, honor her, comfort her,

5
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,411
keep her in sickness and in health,

6
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:02,832
forsaking all others, be true to her,
as long as you both shall live?

7
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,251
I do.

8
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:08,922
[minister] Do you renew
your commitment to this man

9
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,590
as your lawful wedded husband,

10
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,176
to love him, honor him, comfort him,

11
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,055
keep him in sickness and in health,

12
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:21,851
forsaking all others, be true to him,
as long as you both shall live?

13
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,646
I do.

14
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,108
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other

15
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,902
and strengthen your eternal bond.

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,413
[camera shutter clicks]

17
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,961
ONE MONTH EARLIER

18
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,255
Francis?

19
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,762
No photographs when they unload his body.
Will you promise me that?

20
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,212
A lot of people are calling you a hero.

21
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,967
A lot of people aren't.

22
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,243
Francis, I will get this
peacekeeping resolution

23
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,370
passed through the General Assembly.

24
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,750
I owe you that.

25
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,632
So we have the photograph tomorrow
for the presidential portrait.

26
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:19,219
It's what they're gonna
base the painting on.

27
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,557
I'll be smiling. Will you?

28
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,685
[monks chanting]

29
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,566
What are they doing?

30
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,070
Part of a...
cultural exchange, sir, with Tibet.

31
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,947
They'll be here for a month.

32
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,364
A month?

33
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,077
[monks continue chanting]

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,162
[grinding]

35
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,822
Don't worry,
your handwriting's atrocious.

36
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,490
Couldn't read a thing.

37
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,034
- Tom.
- I know. Kate Baldwin.

38
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,202
I know.

39
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,411
Oh. Gold stars for us.

40
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,999
It only took two months riding
on the same plane to introduce ourselves.

41
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,667
Maybe I'm shy.

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,253
Oh, no, you're not.
You just don't mingle with the peasants.

43
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,714
If one of us is a peasant,
I think it's me.

44
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:53,313
I'm sorry I can't stay here
in Gaffney with you.

45
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,023
It's okay.

46
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,816
I'll see you tomorrow.

47
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,111
Maybe tonight, if all goes well.

48
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,322
Feeling optimistic?

49
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,199
I made you a promise.

50
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,495
Well, go on.
You have a plane waiting.

51
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,624
Thank you.

52
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,462
Tom.

53
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,841
[car engine starts]

54
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,682
[siren wails]

55
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,069
[Remy] The Republicans are introducing
a bill that amends the Stafford Act.

56
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,738
They say that the siphoning
of FEMA funds for America Works

57
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,865
- violates the appropriation.
- [Frank] So let them.

58
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,783
It's got bipartisan support.

59
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,827
Dunbar's going to publicly
support the bill.

60
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,871
- What about Jackie?
- She's trying to stay out of it,

61
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,207
but if it goes to a vote,
she's gotta go with the tide.

62
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,293
We don't want her poll numbers to take
a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.

63
00:06:57,377 --> 00:07:00,713
If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.

64
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,383
By the time it gets to the Supreme Court,
we'll have jobs to show,

65
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,344
they'll have nothing but rhetoric.
This is a public relations battle,

66
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,970
- not a legal one.
- Statement?

67
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,056
Just what I just said, less combative.

68
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,351
So, how do we want to do this?

69
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,811
[man] I think the First Lady should sit.
You behind her.

70
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,772
Does that work for you,
Mrs. Underwood?

71
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,191
Uh, yes, whatever works best.

72
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,818
Let me adjust the light for her,
and then I'll place you, sir.

73
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,365
The African bloc just added a provision
to the peacekeeping resolution.

74
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,033
What does it say?

75
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:33,037
Requires African command of the forces.
It's a poison pill, Francis.

76
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,832
There's no way Israel or Palestine
will get on board with that.

77
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,667
You think the Russians are behind it?

78
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,629
Probably. Cathy and I are investigating.

79
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,424
All right, Mr. President.
Just behind your wife, please.

80
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,765
Do you prefer I not?

81
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:53,891
What?

82
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,727
[man] Where you had your hand is perfect.

83
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:00,689
Great. All right.
Here we go.

84
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,151
[camera shutter clicks]

85
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,611
A little more of a smile, please.

86
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,615
[camera shutter clicks]

87
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,243
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

88
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,417
- Any luck today?
- [sighs]

89
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,837
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.

90
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,923
Not that I trust him.

91
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:31,304
So now I just need to see
if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.

92
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:38,102
Today, when we took the photo...

93
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,772
I touched your shoulder.

94
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,692
Yes?

95
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,569
You flinched.

96
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,281
- What?
- I felt it.

97
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,368
No, I didn't.

98
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,537
It was like...

99
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,041
you recoiled.

100
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,381
I think you're reading
too much into something

101
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:09,091
that I don't think actually happened.

102
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,805
All right. Forget I said anything.

103
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,434
Wait.

104
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,229
I just...

105
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,774
Never mind.
I don't know what I was gonna say.

106
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,784
Good night.

107
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,081
[door closes]

108
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,510
[monks chanting]

109
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,144
[grinding]

110
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,755
House must've been somewhere out there.

111
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,175
Well, if you can call it a house.
It was no bigger than that truck.

112
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,305
Nothing left of the farm,
which is for the best.

113
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:40,308
Peaches didn't want to grow here anyway.
[chuckles]

114
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,560
That's what you get for planting on land

115
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,855
with solid rock
two feet below the topsoil.

116
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,525
You know, that's one of the points
that we should make in the book,

117
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:53,446
that hard work is only worth it
in the right conditions.

118
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,115
We want to set people up for success.

119
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,701
Vocational training,
legitimate career paths.

120
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,462
[secretary] Welcome back. How was Gaffney?

121
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,006
Do we have a time set
for Ambassador Caspi yet?

122
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,841
Her office is stalling.

123
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,759
Get her schedule.
We'll go wherever she is.

124
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,845
I think she'll be
at the cocktail reception tonight

125
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,431
- at the Mexican Consulate.
- [aide] I'll call and find out.

126
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,975
What's that?

127
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,768
It came in for you this morning.

128
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,145
Francis?

129
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,648
John Pasternak.
Michael Corrigan's husband.

130
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,026
The latest pile of interview requests
is on your desk,

131
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,069
most of them Corrigan related.

132
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:37,781
And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote
speaker at their Media Awards Ceremony.

133
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,200
How did he know?

134
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,494
About your vows?
It's been in the news.

135
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,372
No, that I liked tulips.

136
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:55,675
- [Tom] Did your mother work?
- As a maid, mostly.

137
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,926
- In high demand, because she was white.
- Mm-hm.

138
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,763
People assumed she wouldn't steal
any valuables, but of course she did.

139
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,723
- Uh-huh.
- [chuckles]

140
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:08,270
I remember one night, she came home
with two sapphire earrings.

141
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:11,106
She took them to the pawn shop
in Spartanburg the next day,

142
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,276
but she wore them all night long,
even slept in them.

143
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,489
I guess she wanted to know
what it felt like to have real jewelry,

144
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:20,491
even if it was just for a few hours.

145
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,661
That does not go in the book.

146
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,248
Why didn't your parents
have any more kids?

147
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,874
That's not relevant to what we're doing.

148
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,710
I'm just trying to get a sense
of your family.

149
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,961
The barn must've been
somewhere right over there.

150
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,756
My father used to escape
in there to get away from us.

151
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,800
Usually brought a bottle with him.

152
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,678
Did you love your father?

153
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,055
He was a good man, down deep.

154
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,724
He cared for us greatly.

155
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,808
Worked hard to put food on the table.

156
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,811
Didn't always succeed,
but that wasn't for a lack of trying.

157
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,607
See... that's not an answer.

158
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,984
I asked you if you loved your father,
you don't tell me.

159
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,320
You tell me what you want me to write.

160
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:00,740
Which is what you've done
since the beginning.

161
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,782
It's time to start telling the truth.

162
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,286
- You think I've been lying?
- I know you have.

163
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,373
The only time you haven't
is that one night in the White House.

164
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,126
[man in game] The worst adventure
I've ever been on. I can promise you...

165
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,670
- I don't get it.
- The game is unwinnable.

166
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:16,171
[sighs]

167
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,382
- What is the point?
- That is the point.

168
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:19,467
[Frank laughs]

169
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,928
I find it unlikely that we'll ever
progress by starting over and over again.

170
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,055
- But it's got to be better than this.
- Oh, God.

171
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,099
Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?

172
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,312
- Something was very clear.
- It just started over again.

173
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,439
It keeps doing that over and over.

174
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,066
Ignore his instructions,
he sends you back.

175
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,235
What if I follow his instructions?

176
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:41,697
- Hm... Chaos takes over. Randomness.
- Ah.

177
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,700
It's impossible to follow the rules.

178
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:47,453
Another time.
It's too much like my real life.

179
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,371
Mm...

180
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:53,417
Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.
You should be asking me questions.

181
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,128
- You're getting me drunk.
- [chuckles]

182
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,714
- I won't remember what I asked.
- Mm...

183
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,636
The last time I got this drunk,
I broke into a library.

184
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,639
- In Charleston, my alma mater.
- Hm...

185
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,390
The Sentinel.

186
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,892
I almost puked all over myself.

187
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,728
That's Chapter Eight:
"POTUS Blows Chunks."

188
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:14,814
[both laughing]

189
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,567
Can you keep it down, please?

190
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,027
[Frank coughs]

191
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,029
- Come join us.
- So sorry.

192
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,365
- I was asleep.
- Oh. We'll...

193
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,492
- We'll move into the study.
- Thank you.

194
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,179
Francis?

195
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,098
[whispers]
I'll be right there in a minute.

196
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,936
I don't like him being up here.

197
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,732
We'll be more quiet.

198
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,859
This is our private space.

199
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,153
- He's my guest.
- He's a stranger.

200
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,701
All right. After tonight, no more.

201
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,662
I'm not being unreasonable.

202
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,001
I should've...

203
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:21,839
realized how much noise we were making.

204
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,344
Can I ask you a question?

205
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,222
Well, that's what you're here for,
isn't it?

206
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,728
Why don't you sleep in the same room?

207
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,070
Uh, that just sorta happened over...

208
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,198
a few months after we moved in here.

209
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,825
Everything okay?

210
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,201
Between you two?

211
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,494
Oh, you bet.

212
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,292
Well, it's been better.

213
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,132
No, it's not okay.

214
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:09,804
The fight.
Coming back from Moscow.

215
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,390
You heard us?

216
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,684
The yelling. Not what you said.

217
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:19,020
Hm... [sighs]

218
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,566
We don't fight often, but, uh...

219
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,949
This one...

220
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,328
scabs keep coming off.

221
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,830
Hm.

222
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,166
We said things.

223
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,839
Things you just can't take back.

224
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,260
It's late. We should call it a night.

225
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,900
Thomas.

226
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,281
I have no interest in salaciousness.

227
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,043
[Frank] August fourteenth
is the anniversary of the New Deal.

228
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,380
- I'd like to hit 20,000 by that date.
- I believe we can do that, sir.

229
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,633
Remy, what's the timeline
on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?

230
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,594
The Leg office predicts the Senate
version will pass in two to three weeks.

231
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,681
Working with friendlies in the House.
Throw some pork on it, slow it down.

232
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,892
That's all the more reason
that we need to accelerate.

233
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,393
If I'm gonna veto this bill,

234
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,146
I want it to be because
it's gonna kill 50,000 new jobs.

235
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,106
- Jobs that we created.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,316
Cathy?

237
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,277
The Russians remain intransigent
on the Jordan Valley.

238
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:53,114
The ambassador is working hard to push
the peacekeeping resolution to a vote

239
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,116
- by the General Assembly.
- [Frank] Why the delay?

240
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,619
We're having a hard time
getting the African bloc

241
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,413
to remove the poison pill provision.

242
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,832
We think Israel's behind it.
They got cold feet,

243
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,419
convinced the African bloc to sabotage
the resolution so they have an out.

244
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,421
Do I need to speak
to the Prime Minister?

245
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,840
Uh, the Israeli ambassador
has already denied.

246
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:12,384
I think we need to keep our focus
on the provision itself.

247
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,761
All right.

248
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,804
The head of the African bloc
is Zimbabwe.

249
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:20,434
And we believe Israel has promised them
a sizable aid package for HIV prevention.

250
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,812
The Secretary and I recommend increasing
our relief funds to Zimbabwe.

251
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,272
Outspend the Israelis.

252
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,399
Well, President Chimbetu
will just pocket the money.

253
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,069
Well, we always anticipate
a certain level of graft.

254
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,321
A certain level? He's egregious.
The man's a monster.

255
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,032
Who happens to run the African bloc.

256
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,451
Who happens to kill his people
when he's not stealing from them,

257
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,286
which is why I reduced aid to Zimbabwe.

258
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,831
If we want him to remove the amendment,
we have to be persuasive.

259
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,292
We are scraping together
every penny we can to save AmWorks.

260
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,837
The last thing I want is to be slammed
for giving additional money

261
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,634
to a brutal dictator from USAID just
to persuade him. This is ill-conceived.

262
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,261
You should think before you bring
a proposal such as this.

263
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,306
[Cathy] We'll pursue other strategies
and get back to you, Mr. President.

264
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,683
[Frank] Thank you. Robert,
what's the latest on the omnibus?

265
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,519
[man] The legislation should go to
the floor in the next couple of months.

266
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,771
The leadership is pushing...

267
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,856
- [monks chanting]
- [grinding]

268
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:29,419
Set up calls with both
Lockheed and Northrop.

269
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,172
We'll pay people to get trained
and call it a job.

270
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,133
It isn't a job
unless the union says it is.

271
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,803
Well, one step at a time. You set up
the training and I'll speak to the AFL.

272
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,179
Are the AARP here?

273
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,223
In the lobby. The chairman told me
they want to support Dunbar.

274
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,642
They're just trying to rattle us.

275
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,686
Dunbar is promising
to save Social Security.

276
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,563
Go after Wall Street and government
waste instead of entitlements.

277
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,648
Well, get them in here.

278
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,609
You have your call list. Their meeting's
not for another ten minutes.

279
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,904
Start bringing them over. It'll take them
that long to hobble over on their walkers.

280
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,281
- [Claire] Francis?
- I'll go get them.

281
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,992
I only have a few minutes.

282
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,377
You singled me out today on purpose.

283
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,880
- What?
- The cabinet meeting.

284
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,840
If I'm gonna invite you
to cabinet meetings,

285
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,800
there's not gonna be any kid gloves.

286
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,593
Don't make it sound like a favor.

287
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,512
You wanted to be there. I agreed.

288
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,015
Well, so I could be informed
and do my job.

289
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:26,018
Everyone in that room is judged
by what they bring to the table.

290
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,436
What you brought to the table
was amateurish.

291
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,190
Both Cathy and I proposed that plan.

292
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,151
I fault her as much as you.
You're making this too personal.

293
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,072
It is personal. I think you're
punishing me for what happened in Russia.

294
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,698
Oh, come on.

295
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,826
Well, you said it on the plane.
Appointing me was a mistake.

296
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,828
Yeah, you said far worse things to me.

297
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,998
Yes, and I've gone out of my way
to put that fight behind us.

298
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, really? Like with Thomas?

299
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:51,919
When you screamed at us
for waking you up.

300
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,129
- I didn't scream.
- It was embarrassing.

301
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,589
Who cares what he thinks?

302
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,841
He was our guest
and you walked in there like--

303
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,052
I think you're searching for things
that aren't there

304
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:03,138
and ignoring the things that are,
like this photograph flinching nonsense.

305
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,806
Oh, Jesus.

306
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,020
- Do you want me to resign, Francis?
- Don't be ridiculous.

307
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,439
- [flicking lighter]
- Just say it.

308
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,691
You never wanted me to be ambassador.

309
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,651
You remember what you
said to me on the plane?

310
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,570
You should have never made me president.

311
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,280
I was upset. I didn't mean it.

312
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,532
You did mean it.
You think you made me.

313
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,326
No, I don't.
I think we're a team, actually.

314
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,412
Well, we're not a team at the moment.

315
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,419
I can't believe we've become this.

316
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,547
- Become what?
- Like everyone else.

317
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,133
[knocking on door]

318
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,220
You ready, sir?

319
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,430
No, just give me a minute.
Let the smoke clear.

320
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,332
Where are we at?

321
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,362
Her hair's different.

322
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,991
But I--

323
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,328
- Where was this taken?
- Santa Fe.

324
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,538
I've narrowed the search
to focus just on that city.

325
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,166
This is all I have,
but I think it's a good start.

326
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,461
- I should go there.
- No. These photos are three weeks old.

327
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,715
- She might have been passing through.
- Or she might still be there.

328
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,093
Okay, but if you start asking questions,
you might tip her off.

329
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,179
Get me more, then.

330
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,099
How's my passport coming?

331
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,146
I'll get the lock lifted
when you find her.

332
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,982
I've shown you some progress.

333
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,735
I think I should be seeing
progress on your side, too.

334
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,777
This isn't enough.

335
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,863
They just arrested
another one of my friends.

336
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,406
- They could charge me at any minute.
- Gavin...

337
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,827
The things that I've had to do
to get this much are fucked up.

338
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,247
An exact location.

339
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,332
That was our deal.

340
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,590
Can you get me the camera feed?

341
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,175
The system's monitoring it.

342
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,927
I want it, too.

343
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,058
I'll send you the link.

344
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,094
[Sharon] Doug? This is Maurice.

345
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,972
He'll be taking over for me.
I'm moving to Seattle.

346
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:35,976
My sister's opening up her own PT center
and she wants me to be a partner.

347
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,478
I'm moving all my clients
over to new folks.

348
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,357
So I can help the transition.

349
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,692
I'll be sad to see you go.

350
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:48,322
I'll go get some bar floats.

351
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,990
Back in a second.

352
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:56,079
Look... I'm having people over
this Thursday.

353
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,416
It's a going-away thing at my place.
You should come.

354
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,751
- [Maurice] You ready?
- Yeah.

355
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,795
I'll text you the details.

356
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,016
[Dunbar] I want to go after the big boys.
Not just Wall Street, but Walmart.

357
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,227
I'd be careful with Walmart.
You'll lose a lot of friends in Congress.

358
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,981
Let's force them to take sides.
That means Jackie Sharp, too.

359
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,483
Introduce legislation.

360
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,860
She either votes for it
or we hit her hard.

361
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:30,197
Any corporation who has more than ten
percent of its employees on food stamps

362
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,741
has to increase wages
until they're below ten percent.

363
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,578
[echoing] Who has the guts
to sponsor something like that?

364
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,664
[high-pitched ringing]

365
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,965
Doug?

366
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,345
Yeah, I'll put a list together. You'll
have something by the end of the week.

367
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,595
Okay. Talk to you then.

368
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,146
[music playing indoors]

369
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,741
[indistinct chatter]

370
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,423
- You made it.
- Yeah.

371
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,176
- How long have you been here?
- Ten minutes.

372
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,929
Come on.
We need to get people dancing.

373
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,098
Actually, I was thinking
that I should go.

374
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,683
I just came over to say goodbye.

375
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,312
Uh-uh. No. You are not going anywhere.

376
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:49,234
You don't have to dance,
but you can't leave.

377
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,209
[Sharon] Last man standing.

378
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,672
- You have recycling?
- Just leave 'em on the counter.

379
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,800
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

380
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,474
You really don't have to help.

381
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,100
I don't mind.

382
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,813
- You're such a gentleman.
- [chuckles]

383
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,940
I don't know about that.

384
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,234
Oh, you're not a gentleman?

385
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,614
Because... that could be interesting.

386
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,319
[Doug groans softly]

387
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,280
I made you a café au lait.

388
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,240
Oh...

389
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,583
How is it?

390
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,627
- Need sugar?
- No.

391
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,295
It's perfect.

392
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,798
When are the movers coming by?

393
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,926
Not for a couple hours.

394
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,389
You need any help?
Packing the rest up?

395
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,474
No. You just relax.

396
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,395
[Doug sighs deeply]

397
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,022
You seemed a little sad last night.

398
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,609
No, just tired.

399
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,862
Was that it?
You were just tired?

400
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,745
Someone I haven't heard from
in a long time.

401
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:08,915
She reached out. It was--

402
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,667
It was a little hard.

403
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,172
Last night wasn't 'cause
you felt sorry for me, was it?

404
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,299
No.

405
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:22,387
Last night was because
I'm getting on a plane today,

406
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,306
and I'll probably never see you again.

407
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,141
Why not?

408
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,154
You know it rains a lot in Seattle, right?

409
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,242
[laughs]

410
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,689
Are you gonna come with me
to the memorial today?

411
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,275
Do I need to be there?

412
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,777
No.

413
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,782
I'm buried right now.

414
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,325
Fine.

415
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,252
[grinding]

416
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,858
[indistinct chatter]

417
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,281
Why has Tom Yates been
hanging around so much?

418
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,074
Is he writing a book on the president?

419
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,452
We've all asked him and he won't say.

420
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,579
Ballsy move if it's true.

421
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,081
Yeah. I can't stand his writing.

422
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,710
Are you an idiot?

423
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,628
I'm an idiot for having an opinion?

424
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,255
There's no opinions to be had.
His writing is gorgeous.

425
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:23,591
Well, in my opinion, it isn't.

426
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,635
Said the guy who can't write
a grocery list.

427
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,346
- Shh, shh...
- [man] Ready whenever you are, sir.

428
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,687
Today marks the 80th Anniversary
of the Social Security Act.

429
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,649
It has survived longer
than many of its beneficiaries.

430
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:43,528
We should all be so lucky
to live as long as it has.

431
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:48,032
But by the time the human body
has circled the sun 80 times,

432
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,618
its youth and vigor are gone.

433
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,913
Joints ache,
bones and muscles are weaker,

434
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,709
the heart doesn't beat
with the same power it once did.

435
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,837
All of us must face this truth eventually.

436
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,090
And when we do,
we must hand the baton to the young.

437
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:09,053
To those who have the strength
to carry on our work when we are gone.

438
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:13,641
Here's another truth:
Social Security is dying.

439
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,060
Now in its 80th year, it must give way

440
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:20,231
to a new, younger,
stronger plan for the future.

441
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,901
That plan is America Works.

442
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,654
In Washington DC alone,
we've managed to reduce unemployment

443
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:31,576
by over a third
and put 25,000 people to work.

444
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,914
If we can accomplish so much
in so little time here in Washington,

445
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:40,418
imagine what we could accomplish if
Congress funded America Works nationwide.

446
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,879
We wouldn't be talking
about thousands of jobs.

447
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:46,340
We'd be talking about millions.

448
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:51,304
Later this afternoon, I will visit FDR's
memorial to pay my respects to the man

449
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:55,015
who ushered in Social Security
80 years ago.

450
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,812
We honor the dead for giving us
the world we inherited.

451
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:05,443
However, we must recognize we are doomed
if we allow the dead to govern us.

452
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:10,072
Thank you, and God bless
the United States of America.

453
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,826
[announcer on TV]
From NBC News in Washington,

454
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:16,120
this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

455
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,498
Good morning and welcome
to Meet the Press.

456
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,542
I have with me Congresswoman Huntley
and Congressman Greer.

457
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:24,879
Congresswoman, let me start with you.
In the President's radio address today,

458
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:29,216
he said the model here in Washington
is a model for the nation.

459
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,302
- Do you agree?
- I do, Chuck.

460
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,346
I was skeptical at first.

461
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,807
Both my parents benefited
from Social Security.

462
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,476
And I've always
counted on it for myself.

463
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,896
But, when I think about my kids,
and my grandkids--

464
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,148
Rebecca raises a good point,
one that we've been making

465
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,775
in the Republican Party for decades.

466
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,152
And yet, while you support America Works,

467
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,363
most members of your party do not.

468
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,782
Chuck, I've never been
a big fan of Frank Underwood.

469
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:56,828
But the park near my house here
in Washington has never been cleaner.

470
00:33:56,911 --> 00:34:00,080
The dry cleaners I go to just hired
two new people this month.

471
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,209
The daycare I drop my kids off at
doubled their staff

472
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,628
so the children can get
more individual attention.

473
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,840
The president may have overstepped
in taking FEMA money,

474
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:12,886
but when something works, it works.
And America Works works.

475
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,856
- [monks chanting]
- [grinding]

476
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,536
Hello.

477
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,546
[grinding]

478
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,248
Promise the money.

479
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:33,627
Whatever you need to turn him around.
I'll approve the USAID funds.

480
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,007
What made you change your mind?

481
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:44,013
Today... at the memorial.

482
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,935
[sighs] You know what struck me the most?

483
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,898
Eleanor.

484
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,069
She was off by herself.

485
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:59,946
Alone.

486
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,950
And so was Franklin. He was alone.

487
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,622
And there was a wall between them.

488
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,586
The monks.

489
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,048
They've been here for weeks.
We haven't even discussed them once.

490
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,676
It's beautiful, isn't it?
What they're doing?

491
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,303
It is.

492
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,311
Francis, I watched them
for over an hour today.

493
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:36,649
And all I was thinking was, why aren't
you and I sharing this together?

494
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,911
We have to do something, Claire.

495
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,539
I know.

496
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,962
What are you thinking?

497
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:01,715
My natural color.
Like when I first met Francis.

498
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,594
- This color?
- Yes. Exactly.

499
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,221
Okay. Have a seat.

500
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,867
I want to take up the sleeves a touch.

501
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,410
Oh, I think they're perfect.
Thank you.

502
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,294
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

503
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,463
[chuckles softly]

504
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,091
[monks chanting]

505
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,524
[chanting]

506
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:05,029
We have gathered today to renew
the vows between Francis J. Underwood

507
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,615
and Claire Hale Underwood.

508
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,701
[bell rings]

509
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:15,081
[minister] It was here, in this church,

510
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:18,751
28 years ago, before God,

511
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,213
that you two first committed
yourselves to one another.

512
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:27,260
[monks chanting]

513
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,348
[minister] May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other,

514
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,934
and strengthen your eternal bond.

515
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,019
[chanting]

516
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,402
[chanting]

517
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,632
- [chanting]
- [bell ringing]

518
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:20,062
Claire's father bought us this house.

519
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:23,649
I wanted to pay for it myself.
That's always bothered me.

520
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:26,568
You weren't bothered to let him pay
for your first campaign?

521
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:30,572
Well, that's politics. It's different.
You take money wherever you can get it.

522
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,825
No, this was our first home.

523
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,495
- Was it a happy home?
- Oh, please.

524
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,250
I thought you brought me here because
we were gonna cut through the bullshit.

525
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,252
This book is supposed to be
about America Works.

526
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,629
There is no book
without you at the center of it.

527
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,633
Do you trust me? Or don't you?

528
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,760
Because if you don't,
get someone else to write it.

529
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:52,845
Or write it yourself.

530
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:56,307
You don't know what it's like to go
through life looking over your shoulder.

531
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,725
Having secrets no one would understand.

532
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,686
I didn't write my first book.

533
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,106
My friend.

534
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:09,236
- The one who died.
- He wrote it?

535
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,114
The first half.
He didn't show it to anyone except me.

536
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,616
In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.

537
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,494
I told him I would.

538
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:21,915
It was too good.

539
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,210
It needed to be finished.
So I finished it.

540
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:29,089
- And took all the credit.
- Oh, yeah. It's my part, the ending.

541
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:30,716
That's what people remember.

542
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,677
But the book...

543
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,348
My entire career...

544
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,310
It's all based on a lie.

545
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:44,146
You don't have a monopoly on secrets.

546
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:59,578
There's tulips buried under here.

547
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:03,332
Claire planted them.

548
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,505
I've always...

549
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:13,759
from day one...

550
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:19,139
been ashamed she said yes
when I asked her to marry me.

551
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:20,807
Why?

552
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,229
I didn't think I deserved her.

553
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:31,485
I can tell you this, though, there would
have been no White House without Claire.

554
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:34,113
I was half the man before I met her.

555
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:36,823
But still, I've been selfish...

556
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,702
feeding off her the way I have.

557
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:42,746
She knew what she was getting into.

558
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:48,627
Probably. She knows me
better than I know myself.

559
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:52,256
Sir? We're scheduled to fly out at 6:15.

560
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,300
Should probably leave
in the next few minutes.

561
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,302
[Frank] Thank you, Meechum.

562
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,766
Scribble away.

563
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:15,654
So, what'd he tell you
in front of the house?

564
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,323
Mm...

565
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:18,949
Nothing much.

566
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,034
Well, it looked intense,
whatever it was.

567
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:25,205
See? This is why I don't ride in the van.

568
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:27,207
You did this time.

569
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,171
Sometimes you just need
to leave someone alone.

570
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,424
All right, I got the hint.

571
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:39,470
I meant him. Not me.

572
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:07,373
Where are they?

573
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:10,250
- Who?
- The monks.

574
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:12,752
Oh, they finished earlier today, sir.

575
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,464
So it's gone?

576
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:17,841
I believe so.

577
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,052
I didn't get a chance to see it.

578
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,970
I'm sure they took a photo.

579
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:26,642
Will you ask someone to get me a copy?

580
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,726
Right away, sir.

581
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,520
[indistinct radio chatter]

582
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,784
[indistinct chatter]

583
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:33,083
Thank you.

584
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,133
[man] Claire.
I almost didn't recognize you.

585
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:43,843
[laughs] Yes,
I decided it was time for a change.

586
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,763
It's very fetching.

587
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,973
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your party.

588
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,226
Oh, of course not.
My staff said you'd be out of town.

589
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:54,980
Would you mind if I borrowed
Ambassador Caspi for a moment?

590
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,064
Of course.

591
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,571
- You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
- I had a trip to Jerusalem.

592
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,283
You promised Zimbabwe 35 million

593
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:09,077
so they'd introduce
the poison pill amendment.

594
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:11,455
- For purely humanitarian reasons.
- No.

595
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:15,250
This is the first time
you've ever sent aid to Zimbabwe.

596
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:18,003
Don't draw connections that don't exist.

597
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:21,465
We would never try
to sabotage the resolution.

598
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:25,302
- The United States is our ally.
- That's right, we are.

599
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,972
- So act like it.
- Excuse me?

600
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:33,352
My husband formally approved our own
humanitarian package for eighty million.

601
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:38,064
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing
the amendment tomorrow.

602
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,233
And when the resolution goes to a vote,

603
00:47:40,317 --> 00:47:43,737
I expect Israel to support it
like the loyal ally she is.

604
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:45,781
Not lie to us.

605
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,116
That's not the way to solicit our support.

606
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,537
I'm not soliciting. I'm demanding.

607
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,289
I feel sorry for you, Claire.

608
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,543
Your husband sends you to talk tough.

609
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,462
But as soon as things go wrong
in the Jordan Valley,

610
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:03,382
he'll turn his back and leave Israel
to clean up the mess.

611
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:04,924
He doesn't have the muscle.

612
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,093
He can't even get Congress
to work with him.

613
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,388
Or back you up after you call out Petrov.

614
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,516
He turned his back on you
just like he will on us.

615
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,064
My husband is the bravest
and most resolute man I know.

616
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,566
He will succeed in this plan.

617
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,359
Brave?

618
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,277
I served in Jordan Valley.

619
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:26,988
As did the President
and the Foreign Minister. Has he?

620
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:32,411
You held a gun and somebody
told you where to stand.

621
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:37,332
Don't confuse that with the burden
the Commander in Chief faces.

622
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,084
Francis has given the order to kill.

623
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,628
He's buried soldiers
he's put into harm's way.

624
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:44,548
And every day,
he wakes up bearing responsibilities

625
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,717
you can't possibly imagine.

626
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,386
They would crush you
if they fell on your shoulders.

627
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:51,555
So you talk to your superiors.

628
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:55,141
And when the amendment
is withdrawn tomorrow,

629
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:59,062
you will commit
to supporting the resolution.

630
00:49:42,773 --> 00:49:44,107
Oh...

631
